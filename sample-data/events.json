Learn the ?two-sticks rubbing together method? to light the fire of character and scenic discovery.  You?ll learn to create strong funny sustainable, organic character and scenes.  Walk the plotless path.  ?We don?t serve plot, plot serves us.?  Students learn to focus on ?Who? and ?Where? so ?What? simply appears.  Meditations and group mind exercises will help you realize that everything that happens on stage is an obstacle or an opportunity, the choice is yours.",
